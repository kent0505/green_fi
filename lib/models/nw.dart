        "By Lananh Nguyen\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - HSBC promoted Lisa McGeough to become its president and CEO for the United States at the start of next year, the bank said on Thursday in a statement first seen by Reuters.\n\nThe appointment comes as part of a sweeping overhaul by new CEO Georges Elhedery, who has made a raft of leadership changes and split the lender's geographic footprint into East and West.\n\nMcGeough, who currently serves as co-head of global banking coverage, will drive the expansion of HSBC's wholesale business in the U.S. Her predecessor, Michael Roberts, was recently elevated to CEO of the newly merged corporate and institutional banking business and will relocate to London.\n\nMcGeough has worked in banking for more than three decades and joined HSBC in 2021.\n\nShe previously spent more than 15 years at Wells Fargo, where she was head of international and earlier jointly led its corporate and investment banking unit. She also ran its financial institutions and industrials groups.\n\nMcGeough is HSBC's first female CEO in the region in more than a decade, and only the second woman CEO in its 150-year history.",

    title: 'German Christmas markets get creative as prices hit new highs',
    content:
        "By Maria Martinez\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - For Eva Henschke, Germany's Christmas markets are a chance to temporarily forget about the colder, darker days with a hot mug of mulled wine or eggnog and a bratwurst off the grill.\n\nBut more so than in years past, she has had to keep a careful eye on costs when deciding what festive bite to indulge in.\n\n'When I come here, I buy something. But you have to pay attention to the prices,' Henschke said at the market next to the preserved World War Two ruins of Berlin's Memorial Church where it was established in 1948.\n\nAs costs for festive treats at traditional Christmas markets hit record highs in Germany, traders are unwrapping new strategies, such as all-inclusive tickets and special themes, to keep attracting locals and tourists alike.\n\n'A crisis makes you creative,' said Fabian Lau, managing director of FARO Group. 'We founded Germany's only all-inclusive Christmas market.'\n\nFor those who want unlimited mulled wine and as many German specialities as possible without worrying about costs, the Christmas Market at the Spree offers all-inclusive tickets starting from 29.90 euros (\$31.48) - for those willing to go after 8 p.m. and during the week. A ticket at peak time, during the weekend, will set any wannabe merrymakers back 45.90 euros.\n\nLau said demand for the tickets is 'extremely high,' with over 1,000 sold daily and 90% of them already snapped up for this Christmas season.\n\n'I think it has changed the way people go to the Christmas market,' said CJ, an international student in Berlin visiting the market. 'With the all-inclusive ticket, I think people just come here with an empty stomach.'\n\nOther creative ways organisers have come up with to draw customers include a market catering to dogs, with a dog show and treats for four-legged visitors, as well as unique locations such as an abandoned spy tower and a former airport hall.\n\n'With more than 60 Christmas markets, Berlin is also the capital of Christmas markets,' said Christian Taenzler, spokesperson at Visit Berlin. 'While the winter season used to be more of an off-season for Berlin, this has changed significantly since the 2000s.'\n\nIn old and new markets, Germany's favourite Christmas beverage, Gluehwein (mulled wine), now sells for a record 5 euros per mug in Berlin, a 50% rise from the pre-pandemic 3.25 euros.\n\nThe elevated costs arise from high energy prices and staff shortages among other factors, said Luba Levkina, spokesperson for activa, which organises mobile Christmas markets.\n\nSedat Sarikurt, a mulled wine vendor at the Memorial Church, hiked his prices by 50 cents compared with last year, despite initial concerns about selling fewer drinks due to higher costs.\n\n'But we observe that both tourists and locals still buy mulled wine,' Sarikurt said. 'It is (just) once a year that we have Christmas.'\n\n(\$1 = 0.9500 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Maria Martinez; editing by Miranda Murray and Mark Heinrich)",

        "(Bloomberg) -- Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce beat estimates after another quarter of stronger-than-expected credit quality.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAs Wars Rage, Cities Face a Dark New Era of Urban Destruction\n\nRiyadh Metro Partially Opens in Bid to Ease City’s Traffic Jams\n\nThe Toronto-based bank earned C\$1.91 per share on an adjusted basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, topping the C\$1.79 average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe bank set aside C\$419 million (\$298 million) for credit losses, according to a statement Thursday, much less than the C\$547 million analysts had forecast. For Canada’s fifth-largest bank, that continues a trend that began earlier in the year. It said the credit picture improved despite a worsening economic outlook.\n\nOverall, the bank earned C\$1.9 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31, up 24% from the prior year, and posted a return on equity of 13.4%. Both figures are on an adjusted basis.\n\nCIBC has been in ‘execution mode,’ according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic, who said in a report last month that the bank is following a ‘relatively straightforward strategy that is neither aggressive nor conservative.’\n\nThe bank put aside C\$483 million for credit losses in the previous quarter and C\$541 million in the fourth quarter last year.\n\n--With assistance from Christine Dobby.",

Lone Star will use the city as a base to expand the presence of its portfolio companies in the Middle East.\n\nAbu Dhabi sits on 6% of the world’s proven oil reserves, is home to the world’s richest family and boasts sovereign wealth funds that manage \$1.7 trillion in assets. That’s helped draw a cadre of hedge funds and venture capital firms, as well as billionaires like Ray Dalio to its burgeoning finance hub.\n\nLone Star invests across equity, real estate, credit and other assets. It’s currently working on a buyout of Carrier Global Corp.’s commercial and residential fire unit valued at \$3 billion.\n\nHudson Advisors, the asset management advisory firm that supports Lone Star, last year hired former Citigroup Inc. banker Mihir Unadkat who worked on Saudi Aramco’s 2019 initial public offering.",

    title: 'Foot Locker revises FY24 outlook as sales drop 1.4% in Q3',
    content:
        "Sportswear and footwear retailer Foot Locker has revised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2024 following a 1.4% drop in sales to \$1.95bn during the third quarter.\n\nThe decline is notable compared to the \$1.98bn reported in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite the overall sales dip, comparable sales saw an increase of 2.4%, with global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker showing 2.8% growth.\n\nChamps Sports and WSS banners also experienced positive comparable sales growth of 2.8% and 1.8% respectively.\n\nThe net loss for Foot Locker stood at \$33m in the quarter ended 2 November 2024, a stark contrast to its net income of \$28m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Loss per share was reported at \$0.34, down from earnings of \$0.30 per share in Q3 FY23.\n\nOn a non-GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] basis, net income reached \$31m for the third quarter, slightly higher than the \$28m reported in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP earnings per share were \$0.33, compared to \$0.30 in Q3 FY23.\n\nThe gross margin for Foot Locker increased by 230 basis points in Q3 FY24, driven by reduced markdown levels. However, this performance fell short of expectations due to an elevated promotional environment.\n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 210 basis points, influenced by investments in technology and brand-building and partially offset by savings from cost optimisation efforts and ongoing expense discipline.\n\nFoot Locker president and chief executive officer Mary Dillon said: 'Our team's continued focus on execution drove positive comparable sales trends and meaningful gross margin expansion in the quarter. However, our third quarter top- and bottom-line performance fell short of our expectations. Consumer spending trends softened following the peak back-to-school period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated.'\n\nFor the full year, Foot Locker now anticipates sales to decline between 1.5% and 1%, adjusting previous expectations from a 1% decline to potential 1% growth.\n\nComparable sales are expected to grow between 1.0% and 1.5%, revised down from earlier forecasts of 1% to 3%.\n\nDillon further stated: 'Despite strong performance, we are taking a more cautious view and are lowering our full-year sales and earnings outlook due to a more promotional environment and softer consumer demand outside key selling periods.'\n\nIn the third quarter, Foot Locker opened ten new stores, closed 24, remodelled or relocated 20, and updated 167 stores to the latest design standards. As of 2 November 2024, the company operated 2,450 stores in 26 countries.\n\nIn April 2024, it revealed a new retail concept designed to improve shopping experience and customer service.\n\n'Foot Locker revises FY24 outlook as sales drop 1.4% in Q3' was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.",

        'XRP Outperforms Uber and Charles Schwab in Market Cap, Macro Guru Calls XRP Chart In the ‘Banana Zone’',
    content:
        "XRP is on a record-breaking rally, cementing its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nXRP’s market cap has soared to \$150.18 billion, surpassing ride-hailing giant Uber at \$150.07 billion and financial services leader Charles Schwab International at \$148.49 billion.\n\nThis places XRP ahead of major companies like pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (\$144.85 billion), banking leader Citigroup (\$136.25 billion), and energy corporation ConocoPhillips (\$137.18 billion), according to Stock Analysis, which ranks XRP 68th among S&P 500 stocks.\n\nOn Dec. 3, XRP's market capitalization briefly surpassed that of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which holds \$158 billion in market capitalization.\n\nXRP also leads its closest crypto competitors, stablecoin Tether (\$135.1 billion) and Layer 1 blockchain Solana (\$112 billion).\n\n“XRP has flipped SOL in market cap. This was definitely not on my bingo card, but it shows how markets can sometimes react in totally unexpected ways,” wrote analysts from the Alpha Please newsletter. “The XRP army has shown us that they are stronger than we thought.”\n\nMassive Rally Fueled by Market Optimism\nXRP’s rally has been fueled by massive investor optimism, gaining 420% in the past 30 days. On Dec. 4, the token hit an intraday high of \$2.64, up from \$0.50 on Nov. 5. The all-time high for XRP was \$3.40, recorded on Jan. 7, 2018. Comparatively, the current price is 22.68% lower.\n\nA key factor behind XRP’s meteoric rise is Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump has pledged to make America the global hub for crypto by creating a friendlier regulatory environment, including firing Securities and Exchange Commissioner (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nUnder Gensler’s leadership, the SEC cracked down on the crypto industry, filing lawsuits against major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, claiming it raised over \$1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP.\n\nRipple contested the claim, arguing XRP functions as a digital currency, not a security. In a landmark July 2023 ruling, Judge Analisa Torres decided Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges were not securities transactions. However, she ruled institutional XRP sales were securities offerings, prompting the SEC to appeal in October 2024.\n\nThe resignation of Gensler in November and Trump’s pro-crypto stance have fueled hopes in the crypto industry that Ripple Labs may see regulatory relief under the new administration.\n\nRipple Labs is also garnering attention amid plans to launch a stablecoin, RLUSD.\n\nAccording to Fox Business, the New York Department of Financial Services is reviewing RLUSD for approval. If approved, Ripple could launch the stablecoin, potentially expanding XRP’s ecosystem.\n\nWhales Fuel the Rally\nWith a \$150 billion market cap, XRP now trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum among cryptocurrencies. Much of its momentum comes from whale activity, as large XRP holders drive trading dynamics.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Woominkyu noted that spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions often coincide with price peaks. Recent data showed whales transferring XRP to Binance as the token hit \$2.30, signaling potential profit-taking.\n\n“Whales tend to move large amounts of XRP to exchanges near local or cycle tops,” said Woominkyu. “This could indicate whales preparing for potential profit-taking or increased market activity.”\n\nKi Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytical firm, added, “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge.”\n\nMacro Experts See More Upside\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt described XRP’s breakout as a “massive coil,” predicting strong bullish potential into 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, called XRP’s chart “good-looking” and placed it in the “banana zone,” indicating it is primed for a price rally.",
